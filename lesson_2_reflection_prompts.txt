** What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git starts to monitor the files in the folder. To let Git know which file he has to check out.

** How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
In the staging area I keep the files that I currently want to commit. I can make changes in a file that it’s not in the staging area, and that will not affect my commit. Also I am allowed to chose which file changes I want to commit by putting or removing a file in the staging area. 

** How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
I should insert in the staging area only the files that are related to my one change, and then commit that change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
when I want to introduce an experimental feature, make a new version (like making the game in a different language). They would help because I could return when I need to the previous version and evolve with it. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
